              Most engineers, as hyper rationale beings above the fray of emotional persuasion are kind of “Ugh, do we have to” when the topic of managing up comes up, so thank you for coming!

              Modern software development, is fast paced, collaborative, iterative, experimental, built on deep and changing abstractions by cross functional teams. <br />To be good at it requires being good at collaboration, coordination, communication, planning, prioritization aka “Management skills”.

              The second key contributor to why managing up in tech is so different is we allow ourselves to believe that we’re apolitical. <br />I have a good news and bad news for you.  <br />Bad news: none of the above tactics are how groups of humans make decisions.<br />Good news: if any of the above have worked for you, congratulations you’ve got a decent manager out there trail breaking for you.

              Again good news/bad news.  The total number of quality engineering leaders is going up! There are better resources, we’re investing more in training, we’ve figured a few things out.<br />Bad news - the demand is going up faster. More teams, building more complicated software, more expectation that work is fulfilling and well-run.

              If you’ve spent any time hanging around career ladders or promotion committees in the last few years (and I mean, who doesn’t, yeah?) <br />Then you’ve encountered a term like “influence based leadership”. <br />Highly correlated with senior ICs (that managers speak for people who don’t manage), principal engineers, staff engineers, tech leads.<br />What does that mean?<br />

              It means I, as your manager, am completely overwhelmed by the accelerating demands of my job, and I’m going to shift some of that load to you.  You’re all drafted and deputized. You’re welcome. <br />But actually this is good news: giving you control of your own destiny<br />

              We know that the largest contributor to people’s happiness, and sense of satisfaction at work is their manager.  That’s the context in which we approach managing up.  <br />End: In tech our managers are barely keeping it together.  So let’s help them.

Before I do, is there any advice you have for me on things we could be doing better?  The data is a bit noisy, is there a format that would be helpful for you? You know, one metric we’ve been tracking lately is cycle time.  Would you like to see that graph?<br />

              Bad bosses absolutely exist.  For the sake of this talk we’ve mostly assumed bosses doing they the best they can.  Which, stretched thin, likely doing a job they weren’t trained for, the best they can do may not be very good. <br />Even good bosses bark under pressure. <br />Bad bosses are something different.<br />But most people aren’t a bad boss.  They’re just stressed and overwhelmed and need help. And that’s where you come in.
