Interviewing for a new job mostly sucks, but the fun part is you meet a whole lot of new, smart people, and also are called upon to reflect on what you've learned. Here's a question I got asked recently in an interview and some thoughts on it. (adapted from [the original Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kellan/status/1523824054259654656))

Question (_from memory, not verbatim_): 

> I'm leading a team, I understand my goals, all I really need from my leadership is a budget and some time, but instead I'm constantly blocked waiting for decisions, and having executives swooping in at the last minute without context. It's profoundly disempowering, why does this keep happening?

First, senior management is largely unaware they are doing this.

Everyone with any level of seniority is aware of"swoop and poop" management, and is taking steps to avoid it. So where does the disconnect come in? It beings with the different perceptions of time (something I talk about in my ["Managing Up" talk](https://kellanem.com/slides/managing_up/), [watch it here](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/management-challenges/)). As a senior leader what feels brisk, having informed yourself on the topic and checked in with a couple of stakeholders, is _ages_ to the person who is waiting in your org, blocked or uncertain about the future of their work. There simply isn't time for you, as a senior leader, to be a diligent competent leader on all the topics that arise. (Nor can be sufficiently a subject matter expert, nor deeply empathic will all the humans involved, etc)

And that's hard to accept.

We're asking leaders to be comfortable being accountable without knowing the details. Being okay with saying, "I don't know" when their boss asks for the details. Being okay with not having had an opportunity to share their opinion with the team. Being okay not doing the things they've been asked to do their whole career. Because those leaders got to where they are by sweating the details, being the expert, asking the hard questions, being persuasive in sharing their perspective, having everything on lock. 

Instead as a leader you need to find a way to get comfortable with engaging on topics you're not competent on. Share your early and unfiltered thoughts skillfully enough to not randomize your teams. Clearly communicate your varying degrees of confidence on the topics being discussed.  Build a culture where people will push back.

Find that path to being okay with being accountable, without being in control.

Instead of control the move becomes having an org you trust. An org that understand your values, goals, thought processes, and decision making. An org that doesn't have to ask you a question, because they can imagine the good you and bad you sitting on either of their shoulders, advising them, without the real you ever having got looped in.

Obviously this is not a complete catalog of all the reasons leadership can disempower their teams, including just bad leadership. But it explains a surprisingly large number of unsatisfying interactions even with people who are good, or just reasonable competent, leaders, but aren't able to find that path, because of anxiety, or past experiences, or whatnot, to letting go of control.

Very few things are as uncomfortable as being accountable for something you have no direct control over or knowledge of, but that's the name of the game if you want a high functioning team that takes ownership in their work.
