I gave two similar keynotes back to back in San Francisco in September. One at [Github Universe](http://githubuniverse.com/), and one at the [Code for America Summit](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/).  I felt like I was bit rusty after taking over two years off to focus on the inward facing work at Etsy, but folks enjoyed them.

This is the CfA version:

And some photos from the GHU one:
