Hi,

I'm Kellan. I made my first website in 1994.  This is the lightly updated version.

I think a lot about software and leading engineering teams, complex systems, and engineering capacity for social change.  Lately I'm thinking more climate change and healthcare.  

I'm also coaching a handful of organizations who want more effective and higher impact engineering organizations.

Any of those topics interest you? Get in touch.
